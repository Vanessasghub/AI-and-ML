## 🚀 Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning predictive models to classify indivduals credit scores in to (Poor, Standard and Good) based on their credit realted features. The goal is to automate credit assessment processes and reduce manual effort in financial institutions.

 ## 🎯 Problem statement 
As a data scientist in a global finance company, you're tasked with building an intelligent system that can segregate people into credit score brackets using historical credit-related data collected by the company over the years.

## 📊 Data Sources
- **Source 1:** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/humagonen/credit-score-clean-dataset)
- **Description:** The train dataset contains 92285 observations (i.e. people), 20 features including the target variable Credit_Score the 20th. While the test dataset has 46120 observations and 19 features.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
A quick list of the tools and libraries used.
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools:** Googlecolab

## 📈 Results

- **Final Model Performance:** The **Random forest** model performed best, achieving an **79% accuracy** on the test set, compared to a 61% achieved by the Decision Tree.
- **Key Insights:**
    - The top 3 features predicting Credit score classification: **1. outstanding debt, 2. Credit_mix 3. Delay_from_due_date**
    - **Business Impact** Automatation of credit assessment for financial institutions.
